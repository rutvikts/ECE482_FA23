# ECE482_FA23
UIUC ECE 482 - Digital IC Design Final Project Repository

## Project Purpose
In this project, we design a 16:1 serializer and a 1:16 deserializer in a 45-nm CMOS technology. We also design a pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) generator circuit; that provides the test data for our circuit.
